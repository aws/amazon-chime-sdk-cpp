# Amazon Chime SDK for C++
[Amazon Chime SDK Project Board](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/projectboard.html)

## Build video calling, audio calling, and screen sharing applications powered by the Amazon Chime SDK.

The Windows client library builds on the C++ signaling client library by including a pre-compiled WebRTC implementation for Windows. So now, developers do not have to select, build and test a WebRTC library for their application. Developers still retain access to the audio and video frames for low-level integrations with microphone, speaker, and video devices.

We also have an [Amazon Chime SDK Project Board](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/projectboard.html) where you can find community requests and their statuses.
