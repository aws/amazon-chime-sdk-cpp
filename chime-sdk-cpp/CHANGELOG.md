## [0.10.0] - 2023-11-02

### Fixed
* Fixed video crashes when race condition occurs.
* Disable audio redundancy by default.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-06-15

### Added
* Added `AudioProcessor` interface
* Added `NoOpAudioProcessor`
* Added `DefaultAudioProcessor`
  * `DefaultAudioProcessor` can toggle the high pass filter, echo canceller, noise suppressor, automatic gain controller, and Voice Focus in real-time via `GetConfiguration()` and `SetConfiguration()`
* Added `AudioContext` interface that replaces `AudioDriver`
* Added `enable_audio_redundancy` option in `AudioConfiguration` to enable redundant audio encoding (as specified in RFC 2198 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2198). Redundant audio encoding improves packet loss recovery.
* Added parsing of remote audio rtc stats inside `VideoClientRtcStatsAdapter`.
* (**Breaking**) Added `codecPreference` in `AddLocalVideo` API of `AudioVideoController`
* Added `AddInputNode`, `AddOutputNode`, `RemoveInputNode`, `RemoveOutputNode` to `AudioContext`
* Use implementation of `AudioNode` for sending and receiving data to/from the media server
* Move `AudioProcessor` and `AudioResampler` into `AudioContext`
* Allow `AudioProcessor` injection through `AudioContextFactory`
* Added `PrefixLogger` class to add prefixes to logging output

### Fixed
* Remove references to pinpoint.
* Fixed the issue where media client did not stop when server stops.
* Upgraded libwebsockets to fix retry issue.

### Removed
* (**Breaking**) Remove `AudioSource` and `AudioSink`
* (**Breaking**) Remove `AddLocalAudioSink`, `RemoveLocalAudioSink`, `AddRemoteAudioSink`, `RemoveRemoteAudioSink`
* (**Breaking**) Remove `OnLocalAudioSourceAvailable` and `OnRemoteMixedAudioSourceAvailable` from `AudioVideObserver`

## [0.8.0] - 2023-02-03

### Added
* Added `size_y_`, `size_u_`, and `size_v_` to `I420VideoFrameBuffer`

### Fixed
* (**Breaking**) Fixed incorrect values for `I420VideoFrameBuffer`. Previously, values for `size_y_`, `size_u_`, and `size_v_` were used as the values for `stride_y_`, `stride_u_`, and `stride_v_`. Anything relying on size values being used for strides now needs to calculate size or use the newly provided fields
* Fixed `width_` and `height_` values missing for `I420VideoFrameBuffer`

## [0.7.0] - 2022-09-16

### Added
* On `AudioVideoController`, added `SetLocalAudioMute`
* On `AudioVideoController`, added `AddRemoteAudioSink` and `RemoveRemoteAudioSink`. These are additional ways to add audio sinks. One can still add audio sinks with `OnRemoteAudioSourceAvailable`.
* On `AudioVideoObserver`, added `OnLocalAudioSourceAvailable`
* `CVPixelVideoFrameBuffer` used for iOS and OSX specific `VideoFrame`s
* `AudioDriver` and associated classes/structs in `audio_driver.h`. Internally system specific drivers will be used unless custom driver is injected.
* Custom `AudioDriver` added to `MeetingSessionDependencies` in order to allow `AudioDriver`s to be injected
* `kFloat32` added as additional audio sample format type for `SampleFormat`
* `PullAudio` method added to `RemoteAudioSource`
* `LocalAudioSource`, an implementation of `AudioSource`

### Changed
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoController`, `AddLocalAudioSink` replaces `AddLocalAudio` and `Modality` is passed in directly. `AudioSink` replaces `AudioSource` as a parameter
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoController`, `RemoveLocalAudioSink` replaces `RemoveLocalAudio`
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoObserver`, `OnLocalAudioSourceAvailable` replaces `OnLocalAudioSourceBecameAvailable`
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoObserver`, `OnAudioVideoSessionConnecting` replaces `AudioVideoSessionDidStartConnecting`
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoObserver`, `OnAudioVideoSessionStarted` replaces `AudioVideoSessionDidStart`
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoObserver`, `OnAudioVideoSessionStopped` replaces `AudioVideoSessionDidStop`
* (**Breaking**) On `AudioVideoObserver`, `OnRemoteAudioSourceBecameAvailable` replaces `OnRemoteMixedAudioSourceAvailable`

### Removed
* (**Breaking**) Removed `AudioSourceConfiguration`
* Removed usage of Unified Plan video client flag which no longer exists.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-02-09

### Added
* Added `DataMessageDispatcher` to help dispatch messages by topic.
* Added support for integration with Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Transcribe Medical for live transcription. The Amazon Chime Service 
uses its active talker algorithm to select the top two active talkers, and sends their audio to Amazon Transcribe 
(or Amazon Transcribe Medical) in your AWS account. User-attributed transcriptions are then sent directly to every meeting 
attendee via data messages. Use transcriptions to overlay subtitles, build a transcript, or perform real-time content analysis. 
For more information, visit [the live transcription guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meeting-transcription.html).
* Added `RemoteVideoSource` as part of a replacement for removing `BindVideoSink` and `UnbindVideoSink` from `AudioVideoController`. You can call `RemoteVideoSource`'s `AddVideoSink` and `RemoveVideoSink` instead of `AudioVideoController`'s `BindVideoSink` and `UnbindVideoSink`.
* Added `OnRemoteVideoSourceUnavailable` callback to `AudioVideoObserver`.
* Added support for receiving stereo audio.

### Changed
* (**Breaking**) Changed `OnRemoteVideoSourceAvailable` to `OnRemoteVideoSourcesAvailable`. Also changed the parameter from a shared pointer to a `RemoteVideoSource` to a vector of shared pointers to `RemoteVideoSource`. This is part of the changes to replace `BindVideoSink` and `UnbindVideoSink`.

### Removed
* (**Breaking**) Removed `BindVideoSink` and `UnbindVideoSink` from `AudioVideoController`. See replacement `RemoteVideoSource` and changes to `OnRemoteVideoSourceAvailable` for details on how the replacement works

* Added active speaker functionality.

### Changed
* [**Breaking**] Added MeetingSessionDependencies
  * [**Breaking**] MeetingSessionConfiguration does not take MeetingSessionUrls and MeetingSessionCredentials as unique_ptr, but instead normal struct
  * [**Breaking**] Logger is no longer exposed from `MeetingSessionConfiguration`
  * [**Breaking**] `Create` function in `MeetingSession` and `DefaultAudioVideoController` now takes `MeetingSessionDependencies` and `MeetingSessionConfiguration` as value.
  * [**Breaking**] MeetingSession no longer takes `MeetingSessionConfiguration` as pointer.

## [0.4.0] - 2021-09-10
